/// The win popup that fades in over the win presentation and holds for a tier-dependent beat.
///
/// SlotView keeps replaying its stage 1 — every winning symbol at once — underneath for as
/// long as this popup is up, so the popup reads as an overlay on a live grid rather than as
/// an interruption. Spin is blocked for the whole time, through
/// <see cref="UIManager.OnWinPopupOpened"/>, which raises the same isSpecialWinActive flag the
/// game loop already parks on.
///
/// Every tier is the same sequence with different data, so a new band is an entry in
/// <see cref="winTiers"/> rather than new code. Big, Huge and Mega go further and share ONE
/// popupRoot — the scene has a single BigWinsPopup — differing only in their
/// <see cref="WinTier.tierSprite"/>, holdDuration and threshold.
///
/// Three things run alongside the fade, all optional per tier: the background
/// <see cref="ImageAnimation"/> loop, a <see cref="PopupPulseGroup"/> that pops and breathes
/// the popup's children, and up to two fountains (<see cref="CoinTossFountain"/> for Normal,
/// <see cref="DiamondFountain"/> for the big tiers). All three are torn down in
/// <see cref="ResetPresentation"/>, which is the single exit both a finished hold and a
