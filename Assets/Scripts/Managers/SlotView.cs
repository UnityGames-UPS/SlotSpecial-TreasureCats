/// REEL MODEL (reworked from the CNY template to the Rich Piggies / reference-game model):
///
///   Each column is one RectTransform ("Slot") holding a fixed strip of <see cref="SlotSymbolView"/>
///   cells. Spinning tweens that transform from <see cref="spinTopY"/> down to
///   <see cref="spinBottomY"/> on an infinite Restart loop at a constant <see cref="reelSpeed"/>.
///
///   The result is written into the strip WHILE the reel is still looping
///   (<see cref="PopulateResultMatrix"/>), so by the time the column is told to stop the
///   correct symbols are already in place. Stopping just kills the loop, snaps the column
///   back to spinTopY and runs a single OutBack tween down to <see cref="restY"/>, which
///   parks the result cells inside the mask.
///
///   The old CNY model (7 images per reel, sprite-shifting every cycle, "2 + row" visible
///   window, snap-the-result-in-at-stop) is gone — all geometry now comes from the
///   serialized <see cref="allCells"/> / <see cref="resultCells"/> lists.
