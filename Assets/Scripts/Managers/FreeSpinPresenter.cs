/// background swap, the in-round spin counter and the closing congratulations sequence.
///
/// It owns PRESENTATION only. GameManager still owns the state machine and the server still
/// owns every number — this class is handed a <see cref="FreeSpinRound"/> and animates it.
///
/// Two beats here are unusual and worth knowing before changing anything:
///
///   THE REELS SPIN THROUGH THE INTRO. Once the player dismisses the trigger popup the first
///   free spin is requested immediately and its reels loop, under the black overlay, behind
///   the per-pig popups — for however long those take. <see cref="IsIntroBlocking"/> is what
///   holds GameManager's cosmetic spin timer open, and it is also why this presenter must NOT
///   cancel itself when that spin starts (see <see cref="CancelImmediate"/>).
///
///   THE RED POPUP CLOSES DIFFERENTLY. Blue and Yellow scale down; the wild popup fades out
///   through its CanvasGroup, timed off its glow reaching zero. Its waves animation is
///   REPARENTED out of the popup in Awake so it does not scale with it.
